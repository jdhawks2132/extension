## Learning Goals

This application was built during Phase 4 of Flatiron School's software engineering program. The main learning objective was to utilize React/ Rails tech stack to demonstrate RESTful API conventions, user authentication/authorization, and full CRUD. As a team, we also decided to explore the Redux Toolkit and RTK Query as our state and API Manager.
